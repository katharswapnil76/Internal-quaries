[OCI] How To Upgrade AHF Component In DBCS VMBM Environment (Doc ID 2830521.1)

To check ORACHECK is enabled or not ?
systemctl status oracle-orachkscheduler.service

To check if TFA is enabled or not ?
systemctl status oracle-tfa.service
ps -ef | grep -i tfa | grep -v grep

To check AHF location :
cat /etc/oracle.ahf.loc

To check for the AHF status:

/opt/oracle/dcs/oracle.ahf/bin/ahfctl statusahf
/opt/oracle/dcs/oracle.ahf/bin/ahfctl stopahf
/opt/oracle/dcs/oracle.ahf/bin/ahfctl startahf

$ cd /u01/software
 $ unzip -oq AHF-LINUX_v19.3.0.zip
 $ mkdir -p $ORACLE_HOME/ahf
 $ ./ahf_setup -ahf_loc $ORACLE_HOME/ahf

# root
 cd /opt/oracle.ahf/bin
 # non-root
 cd $ORACLE_HOME/ahf/oracle.ahf/bin
# on-demand

Points to remember :

	1. The SQLNET.ORA file is only read once on creation of a process. RDBMS Background process and shared server dispatchers will need to be restarted for parameter changes in the SQLNET.ORA to be  picked up. Once a process has started to be traced, tracing will not stop until that the process stops. 
	2. In an environment where both GRID and RDBMS homes are installed, instance would reference a sqlnet.ora file in RDBMS_HOME/network/admin by default.  (Whereas the listener would refer to  GRID_HOME/network/admin for its .ora files)


How to open Port in linux :
--------------------------------------
Linux 6: 
Open port 1521 in the firewall for remote users by root.
[root@primary01 ~]# iptables -I INPUT -p tcp -m state --state NEW -m tcp --dport 1521 -j ACCEPT
[root@primary01 ~]# iptables -L -n
Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination
...
ACCEPT     tcp  --  0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0           state NEW tcp dpt:1521
...
Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination

Don't forget to save the change.
[root@primary01 ~]# service iptables save
iptables: Saving firewall rules to /etc/sysconfig/iptables:[  OK  ]

Linux 7 :

Open port 1521 for listener and 1158 for dbconsole.
[root@db1 ~]# firewall-cmd --state

NOTE:1627807.1 - Step by step method to implement Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) in 11g Data Guard and 11g RAC environments
Setting Environment Variables Through Srvctl (Doc ID 733567.1)

TNS_ADMIN variable is not defined correctly on all nodes to point to the correct sqlnet.ora file.
The correct sqlnet.ora is being used by this database and by sqlplus.  (If using $TNS_ADMIN, make sure it is set appropriately.)
If the sqlnet.ora has ENCRYPTION_WALLET_LOCATION set, and the parameter includes an environment variable (example: $ORACLE_UNQNAME), that same environment variable must be set in both srvctl and the  OS session
The directory pointed to by ENCRYPTION_WALLET_LOCATION must contains the correct ewallet.p12 file for the database
 If the ENCRYPTION_WALLET_LOCATION directory does not contain a cwallet.sso file (an auto-login wallet), then after the database is started, it will still be necessary to open the keystore (wallet) manually;
